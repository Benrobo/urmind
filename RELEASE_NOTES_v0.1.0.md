## 🧠 UrMind v1.1

**UrMind** transforms your unorganized browsing into a powerful, searchable memory. Every page, highlight, insight, and image you encounter is automatically indexed — no effort required. Stuck on "where did I see that restaurant?" or "how did I make that?" Just ask UrMind. It'll surface the answer from your real browsing history, complete with sources, context, highlights, and visual memories.
