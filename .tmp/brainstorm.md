**UrMind** is about giving you a second brain inside your browser.

Here‚Äôs the simplest way to put it:

## üß† What UrMind Is All About

UrMind is a local-first Chrome extension that remembers everything you do online ‚Äî pages you visit, text you highlight, images you save, and even snapshots of what you were looking at.

Instead of losing that information in messy history logs or bookmarks, UrMind captures and organizes it into a personal, searchable memory layer.

Later, you can open a Spotlight-style search and ask questions in natural language, like:

‚ÄúWhat was I reading about Xbox yesterday?‚Äù

‚ÄúSummarize what I researched this morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúShow me the highlighted steps for setting up Docker.‚Äù

UrMind will show you:

A concise AI-generated answer.

The original snippets, images, and snapshots you saved.

Links back to the exact sources.

All of this happens locally on your device, powered by Chrome‚Äôs built-in AI, meaning it‚Äôs private, fast, and doesn‚Äôt need a server.

UrMind also includes a **Mindboard**: a canvas where users can manually drop in text, URLs, images, or files. These are synced back as regular contexts and can be explored within the same canvas-like UI for visual organization.

## üé® The Mindboard Experience

The Mindboard is UrMind's visual workspace - think of it as your digital bulletin board where you can organize your captured knowledge spatially.

### How It Works:

- **Left Sidebar**: Browse contexts by category (Research, Ideas, Projects, Archive)
- **Center Canvas**: Drag and arrange context cards in any layout you prefer
- **Right Sidebar**: Click any context to see full details, sources, and metadata
- **Manual Addition**: Drop in new text, URLs, images, or files directly onto the canvas

### Visual Organization Benefits:

- **Spatial Memory**: Arrange related contexts near each other for quick visual recall
- **Flexible Layout**: No rigid structure - organize however makes sense to you
- **Quick Access**: Click any context card to see full details without losing your place
- **Category Filtering**: Focus on specific types of content with sidebar filters

The Mindboard bridges the gap between automatic context capture and manual knowledge curation, giving you the best of both worlds - AI-powered organization with human spatial intelligence.
